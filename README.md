This will be more like a journal and a thought process but I think it also serves as documentation :D

The structure:
    -> will be based on a lazy column that contains cards with each Tip
        -> Tips will have a title, image and body
        -> Tips will be implemented as a data class 
        -> the cards will be saved under ui.components/TipCard.kt
    -> when using landscape the layout within the cards will change for better display

Features that *might* be added:
    -> when tapping on a card you can focus it entirely
    -> when tapping on the picture of a card you can see the picture in full size and zoomable
